# Cinematiq

This is an example of building a movie streaming website with Django.  It uses HLS to stream different chinks of movies that have been chunked into smaller files for streaming. 

# Movies
The movies have been chunked into different .ts files that are combined into a playlist that is described in the index.m3u8 file.  For space concerns, I have not included the media/movies folder in this repository.  I used a series of public-domain movies developed by Blender Studio.
